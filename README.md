<h1>Diabetes Predictionn (Machine Learning Project)</h1>
<p> This is a machine learning system in Python that can predict whether a person has diabetes using the person's personal health data. </p>
<p>For this use case, we are using the Simple vector Machine Classifier for our prediction </p>
<p>We would use a series of data which has already been given in the repository, we would train the model a=on that data and we would be able to use the trained system to work
with new data</p>

<p>A sample diabetes data is in the repository</p>
